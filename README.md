# Stack Exchange - Data Science

In this project, I analyzed the Data Science Stack Exchange (DSEE) community by using Python and SQL. I aimed to identify which data science topics are most commonly asked, reviewed and answered. I created a dataset by querying the Stack Exchange Data Explorer (SEDE) database, conducting data cleaning and aggregations, and creating visualizations to draw insights. This project was completed as a capstone in the Data Analysis in Business course in the Data Analyst learning path on Dataquest
