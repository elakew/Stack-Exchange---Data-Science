# Stack-Exchange---Data-Science

In this project, I analyzed the Data Science Stack Exchange (DSEE) community with Python and SQL. I hope to identify which data science topics are most commonly asked, reviewed and answered. I created a dataset by querying the Stack Exchange Data Explorer (SEDE) database, conducting data cleaning and aggregations, and creating visualizations to draw insights.
